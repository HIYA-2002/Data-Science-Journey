# Python for Data Science â€“ Day 0

âœ… Watched: Python for Data Science - freeCodeCamp

## ðŸ§  Takeaways:
> Learned that Python automatically infers data types, but I tested edge cases like type(5/2) â†’ float, while 5//2 â†’ int. I used this to debug why a for loop wasnâ€™t working as expected with range.

> Tested that variable names can't start with numbers or most special characters (like #, @), but _var1 works.
> Used round(3.14159, 2) â†’ 3.14  but doesnâ€™t affect internal precisionâ€”important for financial data.

### ðŸ§  Python Built-in Function: `divmod()`

- Tried `divmod(28, 5)` â†’ returns `(5, 3)`
  - `5` is the quotient, `3` is the remainder
- Tested on other values:
  - `divmod(10, 3)` â†’ `(3, 1)`
  - `divmod(15, 5)` â†’ `(3, 0)`
- Found useful when I need **both** values at once without doing:
  ```python
  quotient = x // y
  remainder = x % y
